For High Risk Prep
Flood Insurance:
Purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Standard homeowner's insurance typically does not cover flood damage.
Emergency Kit:
Create a flood emergency kit with essential supplies, including non-perishable food, water, first aid items, flashlights, batteries, a battery-operated radio, and personal hygiene items.
Important Documents:
Safeguard important documents, such as birth certificates, passports, insurance policies, and medical records, in waterproof containers.
Elevate Valuables:
Raise appliances and valuable items above expected flood levels.
Secure Utilities:
Elevate electrical outlets, switches, and circuit breakers above expected flood levels.
Install check valves in sewer lines to prevent backflow.
Basement Protection:
Waterproof basements and install sump pumps with battery backup.
Seal foundation cracks and use waterproofing compounds.
Flood Barriers:
Consider using flood barriers, such as sandbags, flood panels, or water-filled barriers, to protect entry points.
Elevate Hazardous Materials:
Keep hazardous materials (e.g., paints, fuels) in elevated areas.
Create an Evacuation Plan
