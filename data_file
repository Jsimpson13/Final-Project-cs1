For Low Risk Prep
Know Your Risk for Floods
Visit FEMA's Flood Map Service Center to know types of flood risk in your area.  Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.
Purchase Flood Insurance
Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. Homeowner’s insurance policies do not cover flooding. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect so the time to buy is well before a disaster. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
Preparing for a Flood
Make a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and what you will need to protect yourselves from flooding. Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response. Gather supplies, including non-perishable foods, cleaning supplies, and water for several days, in case you must leave immediately or if services are cut off in your area.
In Case of Emergency
Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies. Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a sump pump with a battery.

For High Risk Prep
Flood Insurance:
Purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Standard homeowner's insurance typically does not cover flood damage.
Emergency Kit:
Create a flood emergency kit with essential supplies, including non-perishable food, water, first aid items, flashlights, batteries, a battery-operated radio, and personal hygiene items.
Important Documents:
Safeguard important documents, such as birth certificates, passports, insurance policies, and medical records, in waterproof containers.
Elevate Valuables:
Raise appliances and valuable items above expected flood levels.
Secure Utilities:
Elevate electrical outlets, switches, and circuit breakers above expected flood levels.
Install check valves in sewer lines to prevent backflow.
Basement Protection:
Waterproof basements and install sump pumps with battery backup.
Seal foundation cracks and use waterproofing compounds.
Flood Barriers:
Consider using flood barriers, such as sandbags, flood panels, or water-filled barriers, to protect entry points.

Keep hazardous materials (e.g., paints, fuels) in elevated areas.
